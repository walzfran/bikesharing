#### Overview of the Analysis 

###### In this module we worked with Tableau for data visualizations to present a story to show Citi Bike-Sharing information for a business proposal. The first thing we did was import the data, we then created worksheets, dashboards and finally a story to show key information from New York City's Citi Bike-Sharing program. The initial data set that was given was helpful for the initial visualizations we created but to take it further we had to clean the data a bit using pandas, once this data was cleaned, we uploaded into Tableau and linked to the origianl data and then continued creating sheets to add to our story. Tableau is useful because it creates aesthetically pleasing visualizations to show data in many different ways for this story I utilised bar charts, mapping, pie charts and more! This program is user friendly and allows us to create useful images to portray data for our business proposal. 

#### Results 

###### Below is a link to my Tableau story

###### Below are images taken from my Tableau story with a bite more information about each slide in the story

###### This first image depicts the title page, for this I used the bike utilization image, this shows each bike and the total trip duration that is has been riden. This image is not nnecessarily as useful for the story that is portrayed but it is an image that grabs attention and will create interest in the story for the viewer. This image allows the user to click on each dot and then the information is displayed for the individual bikeid.

###### In this slide of the story I added a dashboard which has information on how many rides were taken, the breakdown of users by gender as well as subscriber vs. customer, the most popular starting locations & ending locations as well as the start times. In this dashboard I allowed the user to select a starting point and ending point to filter the data which then populates new breakdowns for all of the visuilizations. Below is a screenshot showing filtered data. In both the starting and ending points visuilizations there are pop-ups and labels for the station name and location. Being able to filter the data this way will help to determine a bit more of why these bikes are used and where users are going most frequently.

###### Below is an image that is depicting the number of rides based on the trip duration, it is filtered currently to show between 0-3 hours and it is clear that most users are using these bikes for shorter rides. The image after this one is showing the same information but breaking it down a bit further and showing gender as well as just user. This shows us that a majority of the rides are taken by men, in the first informative slide it does show the user breakdown by gender but this visulization really shows the difference between men and women in a drastic visualization.

###### The next slide in the story shows the days of the week and the start times for the rides, in this image we can see that during the weekdays (Monday-Friday) the bikes are used mainly during 7AM to 9AM and again at 5PM to 7PM. This would lead me the think that most of the users are riding for commutes to and from work. On the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) we see that mid-day seems to be the most popular start time which would show that users are probably riding for more leisurely things such as sight seeing.

###### We then take a look at the Citi Bike-Sharing data and break it down by weekday, gender and then subscriber vs. customer. In this visualization we see that customers are using bikes more on the weekends vs. weekdays and subscribers are using bikes more during the weekdays vs. weekends. This makes me think that customers are more likely to be using the bikes for leisure vs. commute and scubscribers are using the bikes more for commutes as they mainly use the bikes Monday-Friday. This makes a lot of sense to me because if I personally was choosing to to have a subscription to a bike service I would want a regular use for it vs. just for fun.

###### The final image below is showing a breakdown of users by week, starttime and gender. This is similar to one of the visualizations but it takes it a step further and filters by gender. This helps to show us that men are very active with using the bikes during that commute time Monday-Friday and women are a bit more likely to be using these bikes on the weekend vs. thier use on the weekdays. There could be quite a few facotrs as to why more men are using the Citi Bikes one being attire. My mind goes right to what do people wear to work and is it something that they can ride a bike in. As a woman myself, I know that riding a bike can be more challenging in certain outfits like a dress or skirt which is a popular clothing item to wear when going to work, especially in a work environment.

#### Summary

###### Below is information that we can shate with investors based on the data we analyzed. 

* A majority of the users are male
* There are far more subscribers than single use customers 
* A majority of the subscribers use the Citi Bikes for weekday commutes with single use customers utilizing bikes on weekends presumably for leisure. 

###### For further analysis of the data we could look at a breakdown of age of users, this could assist with targeting the correct age demographic to boost subscriptions and another helpful analysis would be to look at station locations in bustling business areas that have the largest starting/ending points to make sure there are ample bikes available for subscribers especially as this would help to gaurantee there was a bike for their early morning commutes and trip home at the end of a long workday.
