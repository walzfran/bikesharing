#### Overview of the Analysis 

###### In this module we worked with Tableau for data visualizations to present a story to show Citi Bike-Sharing information for a business proposal. The first thing we did was import the data, we then created worksheets, dashboards and finally a story to show key information from New York City's Citi Bike-Sharing program. The initial data set that was given was helpful for the initial visualizations we created but to take it further we had to clean the data a bit using pandas, once this data was cleaned, we uploaded into Tableau and linked to the origianl data and then continued creating sheets to add to our story. Tableau is useful because it creates aesthetically pleasing visualizations to show data in many different ways for this story I utilised bar charts, mapping, pie charts and more! This program is user friendly and allows us to create useful images to portray data for our business proposal.

Summary
Based on the data set we analyze we feel confident to share with the investors the following facts:

65.2% of Citi bikes' customers are men who ride over 1M 500K trips in a month.
Based on the customer's age our market should be focused on men and women over 28 years.
According to the trip's start and end locations the most used stations are the ones closer to the building's offices and public transportation.
75% of the trips have a duration of fewer than 19 minutes.
81% of the users have an annual subscription.
Our busiest hours will be between 7am - 9am and between 5pm - 7pm
Additional vizualizations for future analysis
To forecast monthly incomes, we suggest gathering data regarding custom fees and subscription plans.
Add a table displaying the top 50 stations to guarantee availability during rush hours.
