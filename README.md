#### Overview of the Analysis 

###### In this module we worked with Tableau for data visualizations to present a story to show Citi Bike-Sharing information for a business proposal. The first thing we did was import the data, we then created worksheets, dashboards and finally a story to show key information from New York City's Citi Bike-Sharing program. The initial data set that was given was helpful for the initial visualizations we created but to take it further we had to clean the data a bit using pandas, once this data was cleaned, we uploaded into Tableau and linked to the origianl data and then continued creating sheets to add to our story. Tableau is useful because it creates aesthetically pleasing visualizations to show data in many different ways for this story I utilised bar charts, mapping, pie charts and more! This program is user friendly and allows us to create useful images to portray data for our business proposal. 

#### Results 

###### Below is a link to my Tableau story

###### Below are images taken from my Tableau story with a bite more information about each slide in the story

###### This first image depicts the title page, for this I used the bike utilization image, this shows each bike and the total trip duration that is has been riden. This image is not nnecessarily as useful for the story that is portrayed but it is an image that grabs attention and will create interest in the story for the viewer. This image allows the user to click on each dot and then the information is displayed for the individual bikeid.

###### In this slide of the story I added a dashboard which has information on how many rides were taken, the breakdown of users by gender as well as subscriber vs. customer, the most popular starting locations & ending locations as well as the start times. In this dashboard I allowed the user to select a starting point and ending point to filter the data which then populates new breakdowns for all of the visuilizations. Below is a screenshot showing filtered data. In both the starting and ending points visuilizations there are pop-ups and labels for the station name and location. Being able to filter the data this way will help to determine a bit more of why these bikes are used and where users are going most frequently.

###### Below is an image that is depicting the number of rides based on the trip duration, it is filtered currently to show between 0-3 hours and it is clear that most users are using these bikes for shorter rides. The image after this one is showing the same information but breaking it down a bit further and showing gender as well as just user. This shows us that a majority of the rides are taken by men, in the first informative slide it does show the user breakdown by gender but this visulization really shows the difference between men and women in a drastic visualization.

Summary
Based on the data set we analyze we feel confident to share with the investors the following facts:

65.2% of Citi bikes' customers are men who ride over 1M 500K trips in a month.
Based on the customer's age our market should be focused on men and women over 28 years.
According to the trip's start and end locations the most used stations are the ones closer to the building's offices and public transportation.
75% of the trips have a duration of fewer than 19 minutes.
81% of the users have an annual subscription.
Our busiest hours will be between 7am - 9am and between 5pm - 7pm
Additional vizualizations for future analysis
To forecast monthly incomes, we suggest gathering data regarding custom fees and subscription plans.
Add a table displaying the top 50 stations to guarantee availability during rush hours.
